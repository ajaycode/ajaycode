# Management Wisdom

## 3 Tips from Dave Barger (JetBlue) for keeping a company aloft:
Be present and visible to the company and its constituents, but not necessarily as an individual.   Share the spotlight with the rest of the leadership.
Ensure that the management and the entire company are working with the same information and toward the same goals.   Alignment across the team is key.
Communicate three times more than seems necessary and make sure the message is being trumpeted throughout the organization.

  ## 5 Tips from Leo Kiely on meshing two established business cultures:
Stay focused on what you have in common.
Keep a healthy respect for the differences that make you stronger.
Set big goals that inspire your leadership team and your people through times of transition.
Say it again and again and again.  It takes a long time to communicate your vision and future to every employee, everywhere.
Share best practices and celebrate the wins.   Nothing sends a  clear message about the way to work together than calling out the best in the business and celebrating together.
